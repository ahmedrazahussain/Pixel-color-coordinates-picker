# Pixel-color-coordinates-picker
This is a simple Opencv project that displays the coordinates and the RGB color values of any pixel in an image when you click on it. It's a great starting point for beginners to understand mouse events and image handling in Opencv.
## Features
-Load and display an image using Opencv
-Detect mouse clicks on the image window
-Show the (x,y) coordinates and BGR color values of the clicked pixel
-Display the values on the image itself for better visualization
## How It Works
-The program sets a mouse callback function to capture the click event.
-When the user clicks on any pixel, it draws the coordinates and color value directly on the image.
